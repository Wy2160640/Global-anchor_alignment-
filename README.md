# Global-anchor_alignment-
An alignment program with anchor points using Affine Gap penalties to make 3 scoring matrices.
These three matrices are D, Ix, and Iy. These correspond to movement in the diagonal, horizontal, and vertical movements.
Vertical and horizontal movements mean there is a gap. Opening a gap incurs a heavy penalty but extending it offers
a smaller penalty.
